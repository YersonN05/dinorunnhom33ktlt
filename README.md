The Chrome dinosaur game (Dino Game) is a simple yet entertaining game that appears when users are offline. Players control a T-Rex dinosaur to jump over obstacles like cacti and birds, aiming to achieve the highest score possible. With its retro graphics and addictive gameplay, the game provides entertainment while waiting for the internet connection to return.
